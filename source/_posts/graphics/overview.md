## What is Computer Graphics?


`全局光照`: Global illumination

+ Video Games
+ Movies
+ Animations
+ Design
+ Visualization
+ Virtual Reality / Agument Reality
+ Digital IIIustration
+ Simulation

+ Graphical User Interfaces
+ Typography: lattice vs vector

## Why study Computer Graphics?

### Fundamental Intellectual Challenges
#### Cretes and interacts with realistic virtual world
#### Requires understanding of all aspects of physical world
#### New computing methods, displays, technologies

`Computer Graphics is AWESOME!`
